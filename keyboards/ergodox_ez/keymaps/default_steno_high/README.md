# QMK Ergodox Default Steno High Example

This is one of the companion keymap examples to my
_[Starting Stenography with an Ergodox][]_ blog post.

This keymap uses a stenotype layout that speaks to [Plover][] using the
GeminiPR protocol ([more information][Stenography in QMK]).

This keymap is how I had my initial steno configuration, until my hands started
hurting due to having to stretch too far for complex chords, hence necessitating
bringing all the steno keys down a row into what is now in the [Default Steno][]
keymap. If you have longer fingers, this layout may be more comfortable for you.

Other companion keymaps referred to in the blog post are:

- [Default Steno][]: Mostly the same as this keymap but the steno keys are
  configured one row lower on the keyboard.
- [QWERTY Steno][]: A modified QWERTY-based keymap that speaks to Plover over
  USB using standard keyboard protocols.

My daily driver [QMK][] keymaps can be found [here][QMK Keymaps].
