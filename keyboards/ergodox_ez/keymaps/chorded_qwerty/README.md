# QMK Ergodox Chorded QWERTY Example

This is the companion keymap example to my _[Chording QWERTY with QMK Combos][]_
blog post.

It uses [QMK Combos][] to mimic the chorded QWERTY layout used in the [Georgi][]
firmware ([Georgi QMK firmware][]).

My daily driver [QMK][] keymaps can be found [here][QMK Keymaps].
