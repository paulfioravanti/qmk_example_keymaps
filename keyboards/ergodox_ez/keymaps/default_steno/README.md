# QMK Ergodox Default Steno Example

This is one of the companion keymap examples to my
_[Starting Stenography with an Ergodox][]_ blog post.

This keymap uses a stenotype layout that speaks to [Plover][] using the
GeminiPR protocol ([more information][Stenography in QMK]).

Other companion keymaps referred to in the blog post are:

- [Default Steno High][]: Mostly the same as this keymap but the steno keys are
  configured one row higher on the keyboard.
- [QWERTY Steno][]: A modified QWERTY-based keymap that speaks to Plover over
  USB using standard keyboard protocols.

My daily driver [QMK][] keymaps can be found [here][QMK Keymaps].
