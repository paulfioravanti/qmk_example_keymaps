# QMK Ergodox QWERTY Steno Example

This is one of the companion keymap examples to my
_[Starting Stenography with an Ergodox][]_ blog post.

This keymap uses a modified QWERTY-based keymap that speaks to [Plover][] over
USB using standard keyboard protocols.

Other companion keymaps referred to in the blog post are:

- [Default Steno][]: A keymap that uses a stenotype layout that speaks to Plover
  using the GeminiPR protocol
- [Default Steno High][]: Mostly the same as the Default Steno keymap but the
  steno keys are configured one row higher on the keyboard.

My daily driver [QMK][] keymaps can be found [here][QMK Keymaps].
